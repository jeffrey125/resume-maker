# Resume Maker

This app will allow users to create their own resume using a ready-to-edit template, choose a theme, and download it into a PDF format.

### Technologies used:
- React
- styled-components
- react-icons
- react-to-print
- uuid

### Motivation
To practice the following React hooks (useState, useRef, and useContext) by building an interesting/useful app. I've thought of building this for personal use and probably for people whom I know are having a hard time to structure, design, and write their resume.
